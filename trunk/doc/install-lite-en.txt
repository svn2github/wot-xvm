1. Unzip archive to game folder:
   Right click to archive -> "Extract all..." -> select game folder -> "Extract"

2. You do not need to setup anything by default.

   If you want special settings, you need to create config file:
     \res_mods\<game version>\gui\flash\XVM.xvmconf

   You can select ready config file from \xvm-doc\samples\ directory, or use
   online editor: http://bulychev.net/generator/

   Old OTMData.xml configs are also supported in legacy mode, you can use if if
   you do not need new features.

   All possible config options you can see in this file:
     \xvm-doc\samples\Full config\XVM.xvmconf

   All possible config options except markers you can see in this file:
     \xvm-doc\samples\No markers config\XVM.xvmconf
   You can use it if you want to leave your old OTMData.xml and use new features.

   Note: If you changing config manually, use Notepad, DO NOT use MS Word,
   WordPad and such editors.
